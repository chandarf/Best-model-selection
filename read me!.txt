This project revealed which model is best out of some commonly used model.
Different model are tested with same dataset and their accuracy is noted for camparision.

Dataset used =Churn_Data
total 9 algorithms r used namely

LogisticRegression
Naive_bayes
svm import SVC
DecisionTree
RandomForest
KNN
Stochastic Gradient Boosting
Gradient Boosting Classifier
XG Booster


At last we found best model  having high accuracy for given dataset i.e churn dataset is none other than
Random Forest.
